# RSA-Algorithm

RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private.

##### An example of asymmetric cryptography :
1. A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.
2. The server encrypts the data using clientâ€™s public key and sends the encrypted data.
3. Client receives this data and decrypts it.

Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has public key of browser.

Implemented RSA algorithm that can work on user defined block for encryption and decryption.
